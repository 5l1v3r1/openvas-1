 * OpenVAS Appliance:
   * Description or Purpose
   - The world's most advanced Open Source vulnerability scanner and manager
   - OpenVAS is a fork of the Nessus scanner before it's license was changed
   - to proprietary in 2005.
   - OpenVAS is developed and maintained by Greenbone Networks

   - We are using the OpenVAS packages from Kali Linux repository
   - because they are compiled for Debian. This limits us to
   - OpenVAS version 8.
